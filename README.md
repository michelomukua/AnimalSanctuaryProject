# AnimalSanctuaryProject

## Overview
This application models an animal sanctuary. The sanctuary has space for five types of animals: Cow, Duck, Lion, Gorilla and Hyena. The animals live happy lives and are cared for by an attendant.
The application is to help the user find available space to house and feed individuals of those specified animal types. The application will indicate also indicate if there is/ are no space to house the animals. 


## Technologies / Concepts Used
* Java
* Polymorphism: We applied superclass animal references to subclass objects (Cow, Duck, Gorilla, Hyena and Lion)
* Inheritance: We extended methods and fields of animal types (child classes) to inherit those of Animal (parent) class 

## Lessons Learned
 Strings are also a non-primitive variable type.
 Inheritance is a form of code refactoring.
 UML diagram are very useful in projects with mutliple objects and fields
